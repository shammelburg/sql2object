This project was created to prevent developers having to type entire classes from scratch based on SQL columns or Stored Procedure parameters.

### How to use

**SQL Type - Result**
* This requires you to run a query and select a row (with as much data as possible) 
* Right click the row number and select `Copy with Headers`
* Paste your selection into the app
* Select an `Object Type`
* Click `Generate object`

`Note: The data copied from the query result is in a tab delimited format.`



**SQL Type - Stored Procedure**
* This requires you to copy the SP parameters
* Paste your selection into the app
* Select an `Object Type`
* Click `Generate object`

Example - you can copy and paste this into the app
`@FieldId int,`\
`@Active bit,`\
`@Username nvarchar(255),`
